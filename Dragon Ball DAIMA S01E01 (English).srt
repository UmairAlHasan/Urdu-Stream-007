1
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:16,785
Dragon Balls.

2
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:20,335
When seven of these
mysterious balls are gathered

3
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:26,675
and the password recited,
a dragon called Shenron appears.

4
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:33,305
Shenron will grant
whatever wish is requested.

5
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:37,395
This man, Son Goku, may appear gentle,

6
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:43,985
but is the most powerful warrior
who possesses unworldly strength.

7
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,365
He lived in the mountains as a child,

8
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:51,325
searched for the Dragon Balls,
met many friends,

9
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:55,995
and went on adventures with them
as he grew into adulthood.

10
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:02,875
One day, a vicious battle race
called Saiyans arrived.

11
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:07,005
Goku learned that he, too, was a Saiyan

12
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:11,175
who was sent to Earth as an infant.

13
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:20,895
Saiyans maintain a youthful body
for much of their lives.

14
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:25,945
Goku continues to face terrifying enemies
and grows through his battles.

15
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:29,365
And together, with his former rivals,

16
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:34,575
he continues
to protect the Earth from evil.

17
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:47,295
Now, the Earth faces a new threat…

18
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:52,215
CONSPIRACY

19
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:59,475
Original Work, Story & Character Design
Akira Toriyama (Shueisha "Jump comics”)

20
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:44,105
Curse that Babidi!
That crafty little scoundrel!

21
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:47,065
He actually used King Dabura.

22
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:54,325
I can't believe the Supreme Demon King
would fall prey to Babidi's magic.

23
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:56,945
How disgraceful.

24
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:06,915
Dabura… Is he strong or somethin'?

25
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:12,045
Of course he is.
He's the king of the dark demon world.

26
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:17,015
K-King of the demon world?!
Such a world exists?

27
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:19,055
It does.

28
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:24,435
Look at that, Degesu.
Isn't that your older brother?

29
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:29,145
Still the nosey upstart as always.

30
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:32,355
He thinks so highly of himself
as Supreme Kai.

31
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:36,445
He's not helping the mortals, is he?

32
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:39,365
Let's look a little further ahead.

33
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:48,335
You idiot…!

34
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,465
What in the world?!

35
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:59,305
How can such powerful beings exist
in the outside world?!

36
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:01,555
Do you think they could be Majin?

37
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:12,525
They can't be. Look.

38
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,355
Their ears are round.

39
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:16,985
But they're flying.

40
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:24,665
They fire light from their hands…

41
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:27,955
and seem to be able to use magic.

42
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:37,795
At last, Majin Buu awakens again!

43
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:46,645
Buu!

44
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:51,355
And now Buu is back!

45
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,155
Curse that Babidi.

46
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:59,485
He wants to rule
not only the outside world,

47
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:01,695
but the Demon Realm and all worlds, too.

48
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:06,625
I think I'll eat you.

49
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:22,055
Look! Dabura was defeated!

50
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,595
And so easily!

51
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:29,725
And now you're
the king of the Demon Realm.

52
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:39,275
No, no, no, no, no!
We can't be celebrating!

53
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,865
The next target that Babidi is going to
use Majin Buu on is us!

54
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,205
You're right.

55
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:52,875
Lord Gomah! Isn't that a Namek?

56
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,205
Huh?

57
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:57,375
Now that you mention it…

58
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:18,145
They did it! They defeated Buu!

59
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,815
We'll see.

60
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:31,325
I knew he was still alive.

61
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,415
Hey! The sky went dark!

62
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:38,465
What could be happening?

63
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:39,625
Hmm?

64
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,635
Could it be…?

65
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:47,225
Found it! This is the reason!

66
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:51,265
Look! Th-Those are Dragon Balls!

67
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,765
Dragon Balls?!

68
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:56,815
See?!
Those ball-like things they have there!

69
00:06:56,935 --> 00:07:00,775
I'm sure of it!
They're smaller, but they're Dragon Balls!

70
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:03,315
One… Two… Three… Four… There are seven.

71
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:07,575
I can't believe it!
Theirs are composed of seven Balls!

72
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:13,285
But this looks quite different
from the Porunga I've read about.

73
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,585
Let's rewind a bit!

74
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:19,875
Rise, Shenron!

75
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:25,005
So they seem to call it Shenron
instead of Porunga.

76
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:31,385
From the way they seem to be used to this,
their Dragon Balls must be easy to gather.

77
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:36,645
Now speak your wish.

78
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:41,145
I shall grant any three wishes you have.

79
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:43,985
Three?!

80
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:47,575
On Earth they get three whole wishes?!

81
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:50,155
This is a huge discovery!

82
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:54,535
Hold on. What happened with Buu?

83
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:58,295
I don't need you anymore!

84
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,715
Die! Dummy!

85
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:10,635
He killed him?!
Buu kill his own master Babidi!

86
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,475
This is glorious!

87
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:26,775
We lost him?! Where is he?!

88
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,745
Look at that! Another Namek!

89
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,165
Yeah! There's no mistake!

90
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:38,665
No wonder we couldn't find any
despite searching.

91
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:41,005
They escaped to the outside world.

92
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,465
Buu's changed!

93
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,385
It looks like Buu has increased in power.

94
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:54,515
Death Missile Chain!

95
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:05,985
What is with these
unbelievably powerful beings?!

96
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,165
H-Here we go!

97
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,305
See you!

98
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:10,345
I can't believe it.
They actually defeated Majin Buu!

99
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:16,725
Everyone who would
stand in your way is gone.

100
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:34,115
And now you have become king of
the Demon Realm in both name and reality.

101
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,575
Congratulations, King Gomah.

102
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:52,545
Sister…!

103
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:58,135
Excuse me. You're here, too, Degesu?

104
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:02,725
Hello, Dr. Arinsu.
You're looking as beautiful as ever.

105
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:04,725
Why thank you.

106
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:06,935
How goes your research?

107
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:10,355
It's going quite splendidly.

108
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:16,035
More importantly, congratulations.
I see we have a new Supreme Demon King.

109
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:17,865
How did you know?

110
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:22,995
It seems my older sister was also watching
from somewhere.

111
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:29,125
It's not like King Dabura
to go to the outside world is it?

112
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,585
It piqued my curiosity.

113
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:34,755
Isn't that the same as you two?

114
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:37,595
Well, I guess that's true.

115
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:40,555
Still, it's unfortunate for you!

116
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:45,895
King Dabura may have given you
all the research funding you wanted,

117
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:48,225
but he's been murdered.

118
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:53,905
Oh? As king, you're going to
continue to fund my research aren't you?

119
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,615
We'll see about that.

120
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,365
You may want to be careful, though.

121
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:06,205
I mean, who wouldn't be?
They defeated the legendary Majin Buu.

122
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:10,465
If such people were to invade
the Demon Realm…

123
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:13,585
I shiver at the thought!

124
00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:15,965
There's no need to worry.

125
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:22,265
There's no reason why they would risk
the dangers of coming to the Demon Realm.

126
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:23,805
We can only hope.

127
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,305
Now if you'll excuse me…

128
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:28,815
"King Gomah."

129
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,195
Will we really be okay?

130
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:42,655
What?

131
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:47,495
If such beings really came here,
that would be bad, wouldn't it?

132
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:51,625
You shouldn't listen to
the ramblings of my sister.

133
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,625
Even if they ever come to the Demon Realm,

134
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,885
they'd never reach this Demon King Palace.

135
00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:10,395
That's it.

136
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,775
Let's use the Dragon Balls!

137
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:17,525
The Dragon Balls?! Are you serious?

138
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:22,575
The three powerful Tamagamis protect them.

139
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:27,245
Not the Dragon Balls of the Demon Realm.

140
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,835
The small Dragon Balls
of that planet Earth.

141
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:32,955
Earth's?

142
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:35,545
That's right. You saw it, didn't you?

143
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:40,175
Those Dragon Balls
might be easy to gather.

144
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:43,055
But what will you wish for?

145
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,225
I'm sure their power
is based in white magic,

146
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:50,015
so I doubt a black wish like
eliminating them will be accepted.

147
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:53,475
I know that!

148
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:00,655
We make them young.

149
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,025
What?

150
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,495
That's not a black wish, is it?

151
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:06,455
That's quite ingenious.

152
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,205
Y-You're still here?!

153
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:17,675
It'd be nice if you made me young as well.

154
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:25,975
Make them young?

155
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:28,515
Th-That's right.

156
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:35,315
Basically we turn them all into children
to make them harmless.

157
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:40,815
I see! So we weaken them drastically!

158
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:43,235
There you have it.

159
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,365
And for my second wish…

160
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,995
Let's get the Evil Third Eye!

161
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,915
The Evil Third Eye!

162
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,755
You mean the legendary Tertian Oculus?!

163
00:14:55,875 --> 00:15:00,675
It was lost during the reign of
Dabura's father, Supreme Demon King Abura.

164
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:02,295
That's right.

165
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:06,925
Placing it on the forehead is said to
grant unbelievable power.

166
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:12,055
Since long ago, it was passed down
among the Supreme Demon Kings,

167
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:14,935
granting them absolute power!

168
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:19,315
Indeed it would be
the absolute item to obtain.

169
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:22,485
Right? And for my third wish…

170
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:26,985
Please, if I could be given
at least one wish.

171
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:28,195
Hmm?

172
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,245
I'll consider it.

173
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,285
I'll be busy with my coronation party,

174
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:40,125
and making speeches in the three
Demon Worlds and appealing to the Majin.

175
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:44,635
We'll execute my plan after that.
Have my vessel ready.

176
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:46,005
Understood, sire.

177
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:51,765
Ah, I'll be bringing Neva the Namek.

178
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:57,145
He's a little senile, but no one knows
more about the Dragon Balls.

179
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:58,775
Yes, sire.

180
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:36,015
Hurry up!

181
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:40,815
Walk faster!

182
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:46,815
Curses! There's a Dragon Ball right here!
But the darn Tamagami is, too!

183
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:49,785
Hey, good work.

184
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,875
Now hurry up and get in the plane.

185
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,965
Now, now. Don't rush me.

186
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,345
Something smells.
When was the last time you took a shower?

187
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:18,395
A shower? I think I took one years ago
when I fell in the mud.

188
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:24,895
Hey, Degesu!
Switch places with me! I'm piloting!

189
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:27,365
-But…!
-Hurry up!

190
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:30,485
-Hold on!
-Hurry up and switch!

191
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,825
Where are you taking me?

192
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,245
Like I said, the outside world.

193
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:43,005
We aren't supposed to go to outside world.

194
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,295
We've already done all the proceedings.

195
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,335
Is this a vacation?

196
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:49,505
Turn around.

197
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,885
I forgot my toothbrush.

198
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,715
We'll come right back!

199
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:58,015
We're going to go see a young Namek
for some business!

200
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:02,225
A Namek? That sounds wonderful.

201
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:05,525
Other Nameks still exist!

202
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:26,165
Who goes there? Identify yourself.

203
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:32,135
The new Supreme Demon King Gomah!
You can call me King Gomah!

204
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:35,215
Well good for you.

205
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:38,635
You can spare me the details.

206
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:42,605
Just say the pin number.

207
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:44,565
0493.

208
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,275
What?!

209
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:50,605
So you're going to the outside world…

210
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:01,575
Very well. I suppose I'll let you go.

211
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,795
That's all?!

212
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,745
So you're going to the outside world?
Which universe?

213
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:47,795
Universe 7.

214
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:50,005
What number in Universe 7?

215
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,375
Which is closest to Earth…?

216
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,755
Number 3.

217
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:57,425
You want to go to number 3?
That's been popular, recently.

218
00:19:57,555 --> 00:19:59,055
Popular?

219
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:02,765
You mean Dabura and Babidi.

220
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:05,265
Someone else went there after them.

221
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:08,725
What?! Who?! Tell me their name!

222
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:11,105
You're an arrogant one!

223
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,695
I-I'm sorry.

224
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:16,325
Tell me… please.

225
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:20,445
I think it was Dr. Arinsu.

226
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,495
My sister?!

227
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:25,835
Why would she do that?

228
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:28,705
She better not be up to something.

229
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:32,005
Stop wasting time and just go!

230
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,715
You're the one who brought it up.

231
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,605
Trunks, happy birthday!

232
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:51,525
And congratulations
to the Earth returning!

233
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,025
Cheers!

234
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:56,235
Thanks!

235
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:03,155
Hey Trunks, how old are you now?

236
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:04,665
I'm nine.

237
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:08,415
Nine, huh?
You're a little short for being nine.

238
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:11,255
You're one to talk.

239
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:16,135
Saiyans get a growth spurt at around 15.

240
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:18,345
Yeah, that happened with you, didn't it?

241
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:23,095
Well, I guess Vegeta didn't get that big.

242
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,555
Are you picking a fight?

243
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:29,265
Huh? Supreme Kai-sama!

244
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:31,395
What are you doin' here?

245
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:35,735
Well… I had some other business…

246
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:41,865
Huh? Didn't you two
fuse with your Potaras?

247
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:46,285
I thought it couldn't be undone!
How'd you do it?!

248
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:52,045
You and Vegeta-san fused with the Potaras,
but when you were absorbed by Majin Buu,

249
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:56,085
for some reason
it was undone and you split apart again.

250
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:02,885
We remembered that
and asked Buu-san to try it again.

251
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:06,015
When I inhaled them and spit them out,
they were separated.

252
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:09,055
It appears that Majin Buu's body produces

253
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:14,735
a mysterious gas
that can reverse a Potara fusion.

254
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:19,945
Oh come on.
So you didn't really wanna fuse after all?

255
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:23,325
Well, Kibito is a little old, so…

256
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:28,205
You never cease to amaze, Goku.

257
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:34,295
You actually asked Shenron to make Buu
a good guy and let him remain on Earth.

258
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:38,505
It doesn't look like Gohan-san is here.

259
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:42,845
Gohan's bein' a little distant.

260
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:45,465
He said he's busy studyin'.

261
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:50,185
I suppose he couldn't study much
with all the fighting.

262
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,145
I'm stuffed!

263
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,275
Now that I've had my fill…

264
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:58,945
Vegeta, wanna train?

265
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:01,155
Very well.

266
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,705
And there they go again all of a sudden.

267
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,755
Just ignore them.

268
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:58,955
Ain't you gettin' carried away?

269
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:25,065
They seem to be having fun.

270
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,945
Shall we join them?

271
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:31,405
We can't. There's no telling
what can happen at any time.

272
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:37,035
You're right. Something happened.

273
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:51,635
We finally made it!

274
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:56,015
Wh-Who are you?

275
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,355
Oh!

276
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,565
It really is a Namek.

277
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:05,275
I haven't seen a fellow Namek
in thousands of years.

278
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:10,615
Are you one of the Supreme Kai?

279
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,405
Not exactly.

280
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:15,865
We came from the Demon Realm.

281
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:19,545
As did your ancestors, correct?

282
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:22,835
See? Your ears are pointy.

283
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:26,085
You're from the Demon Realm, too.

284
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:27,715
Move!

285
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:29,385
Can I help you?

286
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:32,215
I suppose I'll ask.

287
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:36,265
You manage
the Dragon Balls of this world, right?

288
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:41,225
In that case bring them all here.

289
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:44,985
The Dragon Balls?! I can't do that!

290
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:47,565
I figured you'd say that.

291
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:50,525
Good thing I brought this old geezer.

292
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:52,445
Hey! Do it.

293
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:54,365
Do what?

294
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:56,285
We went over this!

295
00:25:56,415 --> 00:26:00,955
I'll extend your life 1,000 years,
so gather the Earth Dragon Balls!

296
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:04,125
Ah yes. Right…

297
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:11,425
Who… Who is that…?

298
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:15,015
The Demon Realm has its own Dragon Balls.

299
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:19,725
He's the one who made them long ago.

300
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,225
But he also…

301
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:28,355
created terrifying beings called Tamagamis
to protect the balls,

302
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:32,325
so for the longest time
no one has had a wish granted.

303
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:37,455
But we heard that Earth has some,
and that's why we're here.

304
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:42,915
Wait. Do you intend to use
our Dragon Balls to make a wish?!

305
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:44,875
Of course I do.

306
00:26:57,935 --> 00:27:00,015
Ah… It looks like

307
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:05,725
they've granted a wish recently and
are still turned into stones.

308
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:07,855
This'll be hard to find.

309
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:39,475
Th-That's…!

310
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:44,855
One, two, three, four…

311
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:46,525
Seven!

312
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,435
-Good. Let's begin.
-Neva.

313
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:54,695
You can restore the Dragon Balls
sooner than normal, right?

314
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:15,505
I don't know what your wish is, but
I'll die before I tell you the password!

315
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:19,515
We watched a video of you and took notes.

316
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:23,435
Rise, Shen--

317
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:26,015
Stop!

318
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:32,565
Is there a problem?

319
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:35,445
Um… Would you like some juice?

320
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:37,525
No thank you.

321
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,745
Rise, Shenron!

322
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:44,705
And grant my wish!

323
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:07,225
Huh? What's going on?

324
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,435
Everything went dark.

325
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:13,145
Could it be that Shenron was summoned…?

326
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:18,575
That's not possible.
The Dragon Balls should still be rocks.

327
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:21,865
I didn't hear about an eclipse.
I wonder what it is.

328
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,205
Supreme Kai-sama.

329
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:27,125
Kibito, did you sense that, too?

330
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,205
That presence…

331
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:33,045
Now speak your wish.

332
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,545
I will grant any wish.

333
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,925
Wonderful! Well, let's see…

334
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:46,055
Turn the ones who fought Majin Buu
and all their friends into children!

335
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,475
Well? What's wrong?!

336
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:57,485
By children, how old do you mean?

337
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:58,565
Huh?!

338
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:03,245
Let me think… Maybe first graders?

339
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:06,825
And for those who are already children?

340
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:08,825
You're pretty picky.

341
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,625
Well…

342
00:30:11,495 --> 00:30:12,455
Make them babies!

343
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:18,335
Well?!
You said you'd grant any wish, right?!

344
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:21,425
Very well.

345
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:42,525
Hee, hee hee!

346
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:47,155
Time to adventure!
You'll be hooked for sure!

347
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:51,785
The Demon Realm is full of mystery

348
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:54,915
DAIMA wonderland

349
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,415
Whoopsie daisy!

350
00:30:57,545 --> 00:31:02,135
Even when your heart shrinks
And you feel low

351
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:06,675
Dreams are everywhere
Don't worry about it

352
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:09,765
Never give up

353
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:17,235
Here comes a New Story

354
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:21,445
Thousands of jabs and silly jokes

355
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:25,035
They're waitin' for you

356
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:32,075
Jaan! Jaka jaan!
The fanfare of courage

357
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:39,835
No-holds-barred battles
The excitement ain't stoppin'

358
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:46,465
Hey Shenron, grant my wish

359
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:54,265
I wanna meet
Someone amazin' again tomorrow

360
00:31:55,645 --> 00:32:00,525
GLORIO
